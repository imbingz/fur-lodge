  ## User Story
  AS A dog-owner, I WANT to find someone or a family who loves dogs as much as me and is willing to take care of my dogs as needed while making money, SO THAT I can focus on my trip with less worries about my dogs. I WANT to see the available hosts who meet my criteria such as budget, care types, number of pets willing to host in my specified city without having to sign up for an account; I WANT to see the host contact and book it directly on the application.

First, you need terminal (mac: pre-installed) or gitbash (pc: must be installed). You also need to download and install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [npm](www.npmjs.com) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) package manager. Open the cloned REPO in your favorite code editor, and then in terminal, enter the command “ npm i “ or “yarn add”  to install the dependencies. Make sure to create a .env file on the project root, and input your own Mysql Workbench config information (see the root file .env_example for samples).

  ## Challenges and Progress
  * Time constrain was one of the biggest challenges. Four of us had less than 2 weeks (besides working full time) to complete this project, from ideation to deployment and presentation. We had to cut down on features so that we could build a functional scooter rathan than an automobile that is broken. 
  * It is first time for any of us to build something of this scale, from front-end (using express-handlebars and Foundation CSS) to server (node.js express.js) to database connection (express sequelize, mysql2), along with new tools for authentication such as passport, passort-local startegy, express-session and password hashing such as bcryptjs. Any changes including the ones that improve the APP could cause unexpected bugs and hours of our time to fix the hugs.
